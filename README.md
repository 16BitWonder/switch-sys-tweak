switch-sys-tweak
================

A collection of miscellaneous mitms that may eventually grow as stuff gets added.

## Features

* `FEAT_NSVM_SAFE` : Mitm's `ns:vm`->NeedsUpdateVulnerability to always return 0 (enable using web applets on outdated fws)
    (Deprecated in favor of setting AtmosphÃ¨re set:sys overrides, by adding the relevant flag in system_settings.ini)
* `FEAT_NSAM_CONTROL` : [5.1.0+] Mitm's `ns:am2`->GetReadOnlyApplicationControlDataInterface to override icon/author/version/name by title.

## Toggles

* `TOGL_LOGGING` : Enable logging to "sdmc:/sys-tweak.log"

## How to compile

Add the required flags to your make command line. `FEAT_ALL` and `TOGL_ALL` are available as wildcard flags.

Example: `make FEAT_ALL="Y" TOGL_LOGGING="Y"`

**Note:** You should probably `make clean` if you change the flags you're using.
